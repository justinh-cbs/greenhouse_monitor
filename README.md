# greenhouse_monitor

A small project to monitor my portable greenhouse and hopefully stop me from killing all my plants... again...  

I'm running this on a RPi Zero 2, and the sensor is a cheap DHT11 that I had sitting around. For better resolution in temp and humidity I'd recommend the DHT22, but I'm just working with what I have.
